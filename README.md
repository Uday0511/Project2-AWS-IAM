# Project2-AWS-IAM
Enhancing the security using AWS IAM


 Launched and managed Amazon EC2 instances for powerful, scalable computing.
 Dived deep into AWS IAM to ensure secure and precise access controls with Policies, Users, and User Groups.
 I tested my settings effectiveness by logging into my AWS account as a new user.

The project's highlight for me was knowing the practical use cases for AWS IAM, such as automating permissions for new joiners in a company or using an Account Alias to customize their sign-in URL.
